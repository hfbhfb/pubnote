# IBM 开发者,很高水准的文章


If you don’t understand and address alignment issues in your software, the following scenarios, in increasing order of severity, are all possible
* Your software will run slower.
* Your application will lock up.
* Your operating system will crash.
* Your software will silently fail, yielding incorrect results.





## Conclusion

If you don’t understand and explicitly code for data alignment:
* Your software may hit performance-killing unaligned memory access exceptions, which invoke very expensive alignment exception handlers.
* Your application may attempt to atomically store to an unaligned address, causing your application to lock up.
* Your application may attempt to pass an unaligned address to Altivec, resulting in Altivec reading from and/or writing to the wrong part of memory, silently corrupting data or yielding incorrect results.
